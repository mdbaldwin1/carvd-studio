# Session Handoff Protocol

**Project:** Carvd Studio - Code Quality Refactoring
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-14
**Status:** Beads configured, ready to start work

---

## 🎯 Quick Start (Read This First!)

Welcome back! Here's how to continue work on Carvd Studio code quality improvements:

1. **Read this file** to understand current context
2. **Check Beads board**: `bd list` or `bd list --ready`
3. **Pick a ticket**: Look for `quick-win` or `low-risk` labels to start
4. **Work on ticket**: Follow the workflow below
5. **Update status**: Mark ticket done when complete
6. **Update this file**: Add session notes at bottom

## 📋 Project Context

### Current Situation

- **Blocked on go-to-market**: Waiting for logo from wife (blocks screenshots, demo video, launch)
- **Best use of time**: Code quality improvements while waiting
- **Approach**: Incremental improvements tracked in Beads
- **Goal**: Improve maintainability, performance, and architecture

### Why We're Doing This

- Can't launch without logo/screenshots
- Premature to add features without user feedback
- Perfect time to address technical debt
- Sets foundation for future development

## 🎫 Beads Issue Tracker

### Commands Quick Reference

```bash
# List all issues
bd list

# List ready work (unblocked, open issues)
bd list --ready

# List issues by label
bd list --label quick-win
bd list --label critical

# Show issue details

   - Must be resolved before other UI work

2. **Epic 2: Component Refactoring** (🔴 CRITICAL) - `carvd-studio-2`
   - Monster components need breaking down
   - Start with ticket 2.1 (reorganize directories) - **Quick win!**

3. **Epic 3: State Management Split** (🟡 HIGH) - `carvd-studio-3`
   - 2,663-line god object store needs splitting
   - Start with ticket 3.1 (design architecture)

4. **Epic 4: Performance Optimization** (🟡 MEDIUM) - `carvd-studio-4`

## 🔄 Workflow for Each Ticket

### 1. Pick a Ticket

**Recommended starting points:**

- `carvd-studio-2.1` - Reorganize components (quick win, low risk)
- `carvd-studio-1.1` - Evaluate CSS approaches (decision needed, unblocks Epic 1)
- `carvd-studio-3.1` - Design store split (planning phase)

```bash
# List ready work
bd list --ready

# Pick a ticket and mark it in progress
bd update carvd-studio-2.1 --status in-progress
```

### 2. Review Phase (if needed)

- Explore the code mentioned in the ticket
- Document additional findings
- Add comments to ticket with discoveries

```bash
# Add findings to ticket
bd comments carvd-studio-2.1 --add "Found 52 components in flat structure. Propose organizing into 10 feature directories."
```

### 3. Planning Phase

- Create detailed implementation plan
- Identify risks and blockers
- Estimate effort
- Document in ticket comments or create sub-tickets

```bash
# Add plan to ticket
bd comments carvd-studio-2.1 --add "Plan: 1. Create directory structure, 2. Move components, 3. Update imports, 4. Run tests. Est: 2-3 hours."
```

### 4. Implementation Phase

**Create a branch:**

```bash
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b refactor/carvd-studio-2.1-reorganize-components
```

**Make changes:**

- Implement the changes
- Write/update tests as needed
- Ensure all tests pass: `npm test`
- Run linter: `npm run lint`
- Type check: `npm run typecheck`

**Commit frequently:**

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "refactor: reorganize components into feature directories

- Created feature-based directory structure
- Moved components into logical groups
- Updated all imports
- Tests passing

Related to carvd-studio-2.1"
```

### 5. Testing Phase

```bash
# Run all tests
cd packages/desktop && npm test

# Run linter
npm run lint

npm run typecheck

# Test the app manually
npm run dev
```

### 6. Completion Phase

**Update the ticket:**

```bash
# Mark ticket as done
bd update carvd-studio-2.1 --status closed

# Add completion note
bd comments carvd-studio-2.1 --add "✅ Complete! Reorganized 52 components into 10 feature directories. All tests passing."
```

**Create PR:**

```bash
git push origin refactor/carvd-studio-2.1-reorganize-components

# Create PR (if ready to merge)
gh pr create --title "Reorganize components into feature directories" --body "Fixes carvd-studio-2.1

Reorganized components from flat structure into feature-based directories:
- common/, layout/, workspace/, project/, stock/, etc.
- Updated all imports
- All tests passing

See ticket carvd-studio-2.1 for details." --base develop
```

## 🎨 Styling Decision Status

**Status:** 🔴 DECISION NEEDED

Before Epic 1 can proceed, we need to decide on styling approach:

### Options

1. **Tailwind CSS** (Recommended)
   - Pros: Fast development, consistent design, tiny bundle size
   - Cons: Learning curve, verbose classNames
   - Effort: 3-4 weeks migration
   - Recommendation: Best for long-term productivity

2. **CSS Modules**
   - Pros: Automatic scoping, works with existing CSS
   - Cons: Still writing CSS, more boilerplate
   - Effort: 2-3 weeks migration
   - Recommendation: Safer, incremental migration

3. **Styled Components**
   - Pros: True component scoping, dynamic styling
   - Cons: Runtime overhead, different paradigm
   - Effort: 3-4 weeks migration
   - Recommendation: Only if team prefers CSS-in-JS

**Action Required:** Work on ticket `carvd-studio-1.1` to evaluate and decide

---

## 🏗️ Component Organization Decision

**Status:** ✅ READY TO IMPLEMENT

Proposed directory structure (see ticket `carvd-studio-2.1`):

```
components/
├── common/          # Reusable components (Button, Modal, etc.)
├── layout/          # Layout components (Header, Sidebar, etc.)
├── workspace/       # 3D workspace feature
├── project/         # Project management

## ❓ Common Questions

### Q: Should I create PRs for each ticket?

**A:** Yes! Small, focused PRs are easier to review. One ticket = one PR.

### Q: Should I merge to develop or wait?

**A:** Create the PR targeting develop. The user can review and merge when ready.

### Q: What if I find additional issues while working on a ticket?

**A:** Create new Beads tickets! Use `bd create --title "..." --description "..." --label "discovered-during-work"`

### Q: What if a ticket is blocked?

**A:** Update the ticket with the blocker: `bd comments carvd-studio-X.X --add "Blocked by: [reason]"` and pick a different ticket.

### Q: Should I run the website or just the desktop app?

**A:** Depends on the ticket. Desktop refactoring = desktop app. Website improvements = website.

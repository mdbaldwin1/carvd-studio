Solves core problems (scoping, naming, maintainability)\n2. Massive productivity gains (2-3x faster styling)\n3. Tiny bundle size (only ships used CSS)\n4. Perfect for React + TypeScript + Electron\n5. Industry standard with huge community\n6. Future-proof and well-maintained\n\n**Trade-offs Accepted:**\n- Learning curve (2-3 weeks to get comfortable)\n- Longer initial migration (3-4 weeks vs 2-3 for CSS Modules)\n- Different paradigm (utility-first vs component classes)\n\n**Why Not CSS Modules:**\n- Still requires writing CSS files\n- Less productive long-term\n- No built-in design system\n\n**Next Steps:**\n- Create implementation tickets\n- Start with setup and configuration\n- Migrate incrementally, keeping tests passing\n","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"mbaldwin@vso-inc.com","created_at":"2026-02-14T22:03:09.420326-05:00","created_by":"Mike Baldwin","updated_at":"2026-02-14T23:30:08.337241-05:00","closed_at":"2026-02-14T23:30:08.337241-05:00","close_reason":"Closed","labels":["decision-needed","research"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"carvd-studio-1.1","depends_on_id":"carvd-studio-1","type":"parent-child","created_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}]}
